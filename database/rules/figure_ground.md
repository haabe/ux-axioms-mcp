# Figure-Ground

## The Axiom

The eye’s tendency to separate objects from their background.

## The Science

A Gestalt principle where we perceive objects as either being in the foreground (the figure) or the background (the ground). The relationship can be stable or ambiguous.

## Application in UX

*   **Modals and Pop-ups:** A modal window is a clear example of figure-ground. The modal is the figure, and the rest of the page is the ground (often dimmed).
*   **Text and Background:** There must be sufficient contrast between text (figure) and its background (ground) for it to be legible.
*   **Active States:** Highlighting a selected item in a list makes it the figure, drawing the user's attention.
