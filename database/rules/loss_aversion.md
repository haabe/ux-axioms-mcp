# Loss Aversion

## Description

The pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. People are more motivated to avoid a loss than to acquire an equivalent gain.

## Best Practices

### Frame as loss avoidance

Instead of: "Sign up to get a \$10 discount."
Do: "You have a \$10 discount waiting for you. Don't lose it, claim it now!"

### Emphasize expiration and risk

Instead of: A static offer for a free trial.
Do: A banner that says "Your free pro trial ends in 3 days. Upgrade now to keep your premium features."

### Leverage possession

Instead of: "Start a free trial."
Do: "Start your free trial and get immediate access to..." Once a user feels they "possess" the benefits, they are less likely to want to lose them.

## Typical Contexts

-   Conversion flows (e.g., shopping cart abandonment emails).
-   Limited-time offers and promotions.
-   Retention UX and subscription cancellation flows.
-   Free trial and freemium models.
