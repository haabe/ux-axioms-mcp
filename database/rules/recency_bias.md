# Recency Bias

## The Axiom

More weight is given to recent experiences.

## The Science

This cognitive bias is the tendency to weigh recent events more heavily than earlier events. In a user experience context, a user's most recent interaction with a product can have a disproportionate effect on their overall impression.

## Application in UX

*   **Onboarding:** A positive onboarding experience is crucial, but don't neglect the ongoing user experience.
*   **Customer Support:** A positive customer support experience can salvage an otherwise negative user experience.
*   **Peak-End Rule:** The recency bias is related to the peak-end rule. Make sure the end of a user's journey is a positive one.
