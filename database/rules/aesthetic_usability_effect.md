# Aesthetic-Usability Effect

## The Axiom

Users often perceive aesthetically pleasing designs as more usable.

## The Science

This effect was first studied in the field of human–computer interaction in 1995. Researchers found that users are more tolerant of minor usability issues when they find an interface visually appealing. This positive emotional response to the design can make users more patient and more likely to see the product as effective.

## Application in UX

*   **First Impressions Matter:** A visually appealing design can make a positive first impression and build user trust.
*   **Don't Sacrifice Usability:** While aesthetics are important, they should not come at the expense of core usability. A beautiful but unusable product will ultimately fail.
*   **Branding:** A strong aesthetic can reinforce brand identity and values.
