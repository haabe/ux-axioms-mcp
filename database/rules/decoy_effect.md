# Decoy Effect

## Description

Consumers tend to have a specific change in preference between two options when presented with a third option that is asymmetrically dominated. The decoy is priced to make one of the other options look much more attractive.

## Best Practices

### Make the target option look like a great deal

**Scenario**: You want to sell the "Large Popcorn".
-   Option 1: Small Popcorn - \$3
-   Option 2: Large Popcorn - \$7

**With Decoy**:
-   Option 1: Small Popcorn - \$3
-   Option 2 (Decoy): Medium Popcorn - \$6.50
-   Option 3 (Target): Large Popcorn - \$7

The Medium is the decoy. It's priced so close to the Large that the Large seems like a much better value for only \$0.50 more.

### Guide users to a preferred plan

**Scenario**: You want to sell the "Pro" plan.
-   Basic Plan: \$10/month
-   Pro Plan: \$20/month
-   **Decoy Plan (Plus)**: \$19/month with only slightly more features than Basic.

The "Plus" plan makes the "Pro" plan look like a steal for just \$1 more, as it has significantly more features.

## Typical Contexts

-   Pricing pages for SaaS products and subscription services.
-   Product line-ups with different sizes or feature sets (e.g., tech gadgets, food items).
-   Any situation where a user must choose between multiple, comparable options.
