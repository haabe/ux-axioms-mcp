# Sunk Cost Fallacy

## The Axiom

Continuing an investment because of past costs.

## The Science

This fallacy describes the tendency to follow through on an endeavor if we have already invested time, effort, or money in it, whether or not the current costs outweigh the benefits.

## Application in UX

*   **Feature Creep:** Don't be afraid to kill a feature that is not working, even if you have invested a lot of time and effort in it.
*   **User Onboarding:** Users who have invested time in setting up an account are more likely to continue using the product.
*   **Gamification:** Gamification techniques can leverage the sunk cost fallacy to keep users engaged.
