# Goal-Gradient Effect

## The Axiom

The tendency to approach a goal with more effort as the goal becomes closer.

## The Science

Proposed by behaviorist Clark Hull in 1932, this effect is demonstrated in both animals and humans. The closer we are to a goal, the more motivated we are to complete it.

## Application in UX

*   **Progress Bars:** Progress bars are a powerful visualization of the goal-gradient effect. Showing users how close they are to completing a task can motivate them to finish.
*   **Loyalty Programs:** Loyalty programs that show progress towards a reward (e.g., "You are only 2 purchases away from a free coffee!") leverage this effect.
*   **Onboarding:** Break down onboarding into small, achievable steps and show the user's progress to encourage completion.
