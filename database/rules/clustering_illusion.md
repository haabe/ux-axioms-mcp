# Clustering Illusion

## The Axiom

Seeing patterns in random data.

## The Science

This is the tendency to erroneously consider the inevitable "streaks" or "clusters" arising in small samples from random distributions to be non-random. The illusion is caused by a human tendency to underpredict the amount of variability likely to appear in a small sample of random or semi-random data.

## Application in UX

*   **User Research:** Be wary of drawing conclusions from small sample sizes.
*   **A/B Testing:** Ensure your A/B tests have a large enough sample size to be statistically significant.
*   **Analytics:** Don't jump to conclusions based on short-term trends in your analytics data.
