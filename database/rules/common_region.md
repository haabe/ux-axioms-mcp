# Common Region

## The Axiom

Elements are perceived as part of a group if they are located within the same closed region.

## The Science

This Gestalt principle states that we tend to group together elements that appear to be in the same bounded area. The boundary can be created by lines, colors, or shading.

## Application in UX

*   **Cards:** Card-based designs are a perfect example of the law of common region. All the information within the card is perceived as a single unit.
*   **Banners and Headers:** Placing content within a visually distinct banner or header groups it together.
*   **Forms:** Group related form fields together using a border or a background color to improve usability.
