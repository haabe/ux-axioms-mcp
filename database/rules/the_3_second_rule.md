# The 3-Second Rule

## Description

A user should be able to understand the core purpose and value proposition of a webpage (especially a homepage or landing page) within three seconds of it loading. If they can't figure out what the page is about and what's in it for them, they are likely to leave.

## Best Practices

### Craft a clear value proposition headline

Instead of: A vague, jargon-filled headline like "Synergizing Tomorrow's Paradigms."
Do: A clear, benefit-oriented headline like "Build a Professional Website in Minutes."

### Answer three key questions

Your "above the fold" content should immediately answer:
1.  **What is this?** (A website builder)
2.  **What's in it for me?** (I can create a professional site quickly)
3.  **What do I do next?** (A clear "Get Started Free" button)

### Use a strong hero image or visual

A compelling, high-quality image or short video that shows the product in context can communicate value much faster than text alone.

## Typical Contexts

-   Website homepages and landing pages are the primary application.
-   The "above the fold" content of any important page.
-   App store pages for mobile applications.
-   The opening screen of a software application.
-   Marketing emails.
