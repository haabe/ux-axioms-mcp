# Social Desirability Bias

## The Axiom

People provide socially acceptable answers.

## The Science

This bias is the tendency of survey respondents to answer questions in a manner that will be viewed favorably by others. It can lead to over-reporting of "good" behavior and under-reporting of "bad" behavior.

## Application in UX

*   **User Research:** Be aware of this bias when conducting user interviews. Use indirect questioning and observation to get more accurate insights.
*   **Anonymous Feedback:** Allow users to provide anonymous feedback to reduce the social desirability bias.
*   **A/B Testing:** A/B testing can reveal what users actually do, rather than what they say they do.
