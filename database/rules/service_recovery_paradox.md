# Service Recovery Paradox

## The Axiom

A customer who has had a service failure resolved excellently is more loyal than a customer who never had a problem.

## The Science

A well-handled recovery from a service failure can turn a negative experience into a positive one, building trust and loyalty. However, this is a "paradox" and should not be a goal. It's best to prevent failures in the first place.

## Application in UX

*   **Error Handling:** Provide clear, helpful error messages that explain what went wrong and how to fix it.
*   **Customer Support:** Make it easy for users to contact support when they have a problem. A good support experience can trigger the paradox.
*   **Proactive Communication:** If you know about a problem, inform users proactively and let them know you are working on a fix.
