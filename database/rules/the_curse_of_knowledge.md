# The Curse of Knowledge

## The Axiom

Experts assume others have the same knowledge.

## The Science

This cognitive bias occurs when an individual, communicating with other individuals, unknowingly assumes that the others have the background to understand. This bias is also called the curse of expertise.

## Application in UX

*   **Jargon:** Avoid using technical jargon that your users may not understand.
*   **Onboarding:** A thorough onboarding process is essential to bring users up to speed.
*   **User Testing:** Test your product with real users to identify areas where the curse of knowledge may be causing confusion.
