# The Pratfall Effect

## Description

A person's or brand's perceived attractiveness and appeal increases when they make a mistake or show a flaw—but only if they are first perceived as highly competent. An average person making a mistake is just seen as less competent.

## Best Practices

### Own your mistakes publicly

Instead of: Trying to quietly sweep a service outage under the rug.
Do: Publicly acknowledging the issue, explaining what happened in simple terms, and detailing how you'll prevent it in the future. This builds trust.

### Inject humanity into your brand

Instead of: A corporate blog with dry, jargon-filled posts.
Do: A blog post from the CEO admitting a product strategy that didn't work out, and what they learned from it.

### Use humor in harmless error states

Instead of: A generic "404 - Page Not Found" message.
Do: A creative and humorous 404 page that admits the page is lost but helps the user get back on track. This turns a moment of frustration into a small, positive brand interaction.

## Typical Contexts

-   Branding, social media, and marketing communications.
-   Public relations and incident response.
-   Designing "friendly" and helpful error messages (e.g., 404 pages, failed form submissions).
-   Building a relatable and human-centric brand identity.
