# Similarity

## The Axiom

The human eye tends to perceive similar elements in a design as a complete picture, shape, or group.

## The Science

This principle is one of the Gestalt principles of visual perception. When elements share visual characteristics like shape, size, color, or texture, our brain groups them together. This grouping happens automatically and helps us organize and understand visual information quickly.

## Application in UX

*   **Links and Buttons:** Make all links the same color and style to indicate they are clickable. Buttons should have a consistent style.
*   **Content Types:** Use similar styling for similar types of content, like testimonials or product features, to create a sense of unity.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** Use similarity to create a visual hierarchy. For example, all H2 headings should look the same.
