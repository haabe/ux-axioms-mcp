# F-Pattern Scanning

## Description

Eyetracking studies show that for content-rich pages (like articles or search results), users often scan in a pattern that resembles the letter "F". They read the first headline/line of text, then scan down a bit and read another horizontal line, and finally scan down the left side of the content.

## Best Practices

### Prioritize the first two paragraphs

Place your most important information, keywords, and conclusions at the beginning of the text. The first couple of paragraphs are your best chance to capture the user's attention.

### Use headings and subheadings

Break up long blocks of text with clear, informative headings. Users will scan these headings down the left side of the page to find the section they are interested in.

### Start lines with important words

Users' vertical scan focuses on the left edge of the content. Starting headings, subheadings, and bullet points with information-carrying words makes scanning more efficient.

## Typical Contexts

-   Blog posts, news articles, and other long-form content.
-   Search engine results pages (SERPs).
-   Product listing pages.
-   Any page where the user is looking for specific information within a larger body of text or items. This pattern is less applicable to image-heavy or sparse layouts.
