# Symmetry and Order

## The Axiom

We tend to perceive symmetrical shapes as a group.

## The Science

This is a Gestalt principle of perception. Symmetrical elements are perceived as being part of the same group. Our eyes are drawn to symmetrical shapes, and we find them aesthetically pleasing.

## Application in UX

*   **Layout:** A symmetrical layout can create a sense of balance and order.
*   **Forms:** Symmetrical forms are easier to scan and complete.
*   **Icons:** Symmetrical icons are often easier to understand and more aesthetically pleasing.
