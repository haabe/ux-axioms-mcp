# Social Proof

## Description

A psychological and social phenomenon wherein people copy the actions of others in an attempt to undertake behavior in a given situation. When we are uncertain, we look to others for cues on how to behave.

## Best Practices

### Showcase testimonials and reviews

Instead of: Just describing how great your product is.
Do: Featuring quotes and ratings from happy customers directly on the landing page.

### Highlight popularity and numbers

Instead of: "Sign up for our newsletter."
Do: "Join 50,000+ subscribers who get weekly tips."

### Leverage expert and celebrity endorsements

Instead of: An unknown brand making claims.
Do: Featuring logos of well-known companies that use your product ("As seen in...", "Trusted by...").

### Show real-time activity

Instead of: A static product page.
Do: A small notification saying "27 people are looking at this right now" or "Last purchased 15 minutes ago."

## Typical Contexts

-   E-commerce product pages (reviews, ratings, "best seller" badges).
-   Landing pages and SaaS websites (customer logos, testimonials, user counts).
-   Booking and travel websites (e.g., "Only 2 rooms left at this price," "25 people booked this today").
-   Pricing pages to indicate the "most popular" plan.
