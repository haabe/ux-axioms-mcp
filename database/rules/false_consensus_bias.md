# False-Consensus Bias

## The Axiom

We overestimate how much others agree with us.

## The Science

This cognitive bias leads people to believe that their own opinions, beliefs, and habits are more common than they actually are. It's a form of egocentric bias.

## Application in UX

*   **You are not the user:** This bias is a key reason for the design mantra, "You are not the user."
*   **User Research:** Conduct user research to get a true understanding of your users' needs and perspectives.
*   **Diversity:** A diverse design team can help to challenge the false-consensus bias.
