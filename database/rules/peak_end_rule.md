# Peak-End Rule

## Description

People judge an experience largely based on how they felt at its most intense point (the peak) and at its end, rather than on the total sum or average of every moment.

## Best Practices

### Focus on key moments

Instead of: Trying to make every single moment of a long onboarding flow "delightful".
Do: Focusing on creating one or two highly positive, memorable moments (e.g., a "wow" feature demonstration) and ensuring the final step is seamless and rewarding.

### End on a high note

Instead of: Ending a checkout process on a plain "Thank you" page.
Do: Ending with a celebratory confirmation, clear next steps, and perhaps a small, unexpected bonus (like a discount on a future purchase).

### Mitigate the peaks of pain

Instead of: A user getting stuck on a difficult form field (a negative peak).
Do: Providing extra help, clear error messages, and a way to "save and come back later" to reduce the frustration at that peak moment.

## Typical Contexts

-   User onboarding flows.
-   Checkout and conversion funnels.
-   Customer support interactions.
-   Product unboxing experiences.
-   Any user journey with multiple steps.
