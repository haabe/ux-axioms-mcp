# The Labor Illusion

## The Axiom

Users trust and value a service more when they can "see" the effort or process being performed.

## The Science

Research from Harvard Business School found that when websites show the work being done behind the scenes (even if it's faked), users appreciate the service more and are more likely to use it again.

## Application in UX

*   **Loading Screens:** Instead of a simple spinner, show the steps being taken (e.g., "Finding flights...", "Applying filters...").
*   **Search Results:** When a search takes a moment, showing the number of documents being searched can increase perceived value.
*   **Progress Indicators:** For multi-step processes, show the steps and mark them as complete as the user progresses.
