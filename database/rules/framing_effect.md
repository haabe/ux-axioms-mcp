# Framing Effect

## The Axiom

Decisions are influenced by how information is presented.

## The Science

This cognitive bias, explored by Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman, shows that people react to a particular choice in different ways depending on how it is presented (e.g., as a loss or as a gain). People tend to avoid risk when a positive frame is presented but seek risks when a negative frame is presented.

## Application in UX

*   **Marketing Copy:** Frame your product's benefits in a positive light. For example, "80% fat-free" is more appealing than "20% fat."
*   **Pricing:** Present pricing options in a way that highlights the value of the recommended choice.
*   **User Feedback:** The way you ask for feedback can influence the responses you receive.
