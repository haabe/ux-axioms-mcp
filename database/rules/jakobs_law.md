# Jakob's Law

## Description

Users spend most of their time on other sites. This means they prefer your site to work the same way as all the others they already know.

## Best Practices

### Adhere to conventions

Instead of: Placing the navigation in a novel, unexpected location.
Do: Placing main navigation at the top of the page or on the left-hand side.

### Use familiar patterns

Instead of: Designing a completely unique e-commerce checkout flow.
Do: Following the standard "Cart -> Shipping -> Payment -> Confirmation" pattern.

### Employ common icons and language

Instead of: Using a floppy disk icon for "share".
Do: Using the universally recognized "shopping cart" icon for a shopping cart.

## Typical Contexts

-   Overall website and application structure.
-   Core user flows (e.g., login, registration, checkout).
-   The design of common UI components (e.g., search bars, buttons, forms).
-   Iconography and microcopy.
