# Scarcity Principle

## Description

People place a higher value on and have a greater desire for things they perceive to be scarce or in limited supply. This can be based on quantity (limited stock) or time (limited offer).

## Best Practices

### Use time-based scarcity

Instead of: "Sale on now."
Do: "Sale ends in 23:59:59." A countdown timer makes the time limitation more salient.

### Use quantity-based scarcity

Instead of: A product page for a popular item.
Do: Adding a "Only 3 left in stock - order soon" message to the product page.

### Create exclusivity

Instead of: "Sign up for our beta."
Do: "Request an invite for our exclusive beta." The "invite-only" framing suggests scarcity and increases perceived value.

## Typical Contexts

-   E-commerce and flash sale sites (e.g., "Deal of the day").
-   Travel and booking websites (e.g., "1 room left at this price").
-   Event ticket sales (e.g., "Early bird pricing ends Friday").
-   Marketing for limited edition or exclusive products.
-   Online course enrollment with cohort deadlines.
