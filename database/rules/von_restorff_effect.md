# Von Restorff Effect

## Description

Also known as the Isolation Effect, this predicts that when multiple similar objects are present, the one that differs from the rest is most likely to be remembered and attended to.

## Best Practices

### Make the primary CTA distinctive

Instead of: All buttons on a page being the same color and size.
Do: Making the primary call-to-action (e.g., "Add to Cart") a bold, contrasting color while secondary actions ("Save for Later") are styled as less prominent links or ghost buttons.

### Highlight the recommended option

Instead of: A pricing table with three identical columns.
Do: Placing a border, a different background color, or a "Most Popular" banner on the recommended plan to make it stand out.

### Don't make everything stand out

Instead of: Using bold colors, large fonts, and animations on many different elements at once.
Do: Using visual distinction sparingly and purposefully. If everything is emphasized, nothing is emphasized.

## Typical Contexts

-   Call-to-action (CTA) buttons.
-   Pricing tables to highlight a preferred plan.
-   Alerts, notifications, and error messages that need to capture the user's attention.
-   Highlighting a sale price or special offer.
-   Drawing attention to important information within a block of text.
