# Anchoring Bias

## Description

The tendency to rely too heavily on the first piece of information offered (the "anchor") when making decisions. Subsequent judgments are made by adjusting away from that anchor, and there is a bias toward interpreting other information around the anchor.

## Best Practices

### Set a favorable anchor

Instead of: Just showing a price of \$50.
Do: Showing a crossed-out "Was \$100" next to the current \$50 price. The \$100 is the anchor, making \$50 seem like a great deal.

### Anchor with the highest-tier option

Instead of: Showing a "Basic" plan first on a pricing page.
Do: Showing a "Pro" or "Enterprise" plan first (on the left). This anchors the user to a higher price and set of features, making other plans seem more reasonable in comparison.

### Expose users to incidental high numbers

Instead of: A donation form with an empty field.
Do: A donation form that pre-suggests amounts like "Choose an amount: \$50, \$100, \$250, Other". The higher numbers act as an anchor, potentially increasing the average donation amount.

## Typical Contexts

-   Pricing pages and subscription tiers.
-   Sales, discounts, and promotional materials.
-   Negotiation interfaces (e.g., "make an offer" on a product).
-   Donation or fundraising forms.
