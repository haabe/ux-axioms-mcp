# Serial-Position Effect

## The Axiom

People tend to remember the first and last items in a series best.

## The Science

This effect, first described by Hermann Ebbinghaus, is a combination of two other effects: the primacy effect (better recall for items at the beginning of a list) and the recency effect (better recall for items at the end of a list).

## Application in UX

*   **Navigation:** Place the most important navigation links at the beginning and end of a menu.
*   **Lists:** When presenting a list of features or benefits, put the most important ones at the top and bottom.
*   **Content:** In long-form content, make sure your introduction and conclusion are strong and summarize the key takeaways.
