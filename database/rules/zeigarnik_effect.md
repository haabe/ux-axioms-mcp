# Zeigarnik Effect

## Description

People remember uncompleted or interrupted tasks better than completed tasks. The brain has a need for closure, creating intrusive thoughts about the unfinished task until it is completed.

## Best Practices

### Show progress and completion status

Instead of: A long, single-page form with no end in sight.
Do: A multi-step form with a clear progress bar (e.g., "Step 2 of 4"). This visually represents the incompleteness and motivates the user to finish.

### Remind users of incomplete tasks

Instead of: Hoping a user remembers to finish setting up their profile.
Do: Displaying a notification on the dashboard: "Your profile is 80% complete. Finish it now to get better recommendations."

### Leverage in media consumption

Instead of: A video that just ends.
Do: An "up next" auto-play countdown that encourages the user to continue watching the next episode in a series. The unresolved plot is the incomplete task.

## Typical Contexts

-   Onboarding flows and profile setup wizards.
-   Multi-step forms and checkout processes.
-   Learning platforms and course progress indicators.
-   Video game level design and quest logs.
-   Shopping cart abandonment emails ("You left something behind!").
