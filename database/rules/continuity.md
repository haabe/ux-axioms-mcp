# Continuity

## The Axiom

Elements arranged on a line or curve are perceived as more related than elements not on the line or curve.

## The Science

Another Gestalt principle. The human eye will follow the smoothest path when viewing lines, regardless of how the lines were actually drawn. This continuation occurs even when there are gaps in the line.

## Application in UX

*   **Navigation:** Align navigation links in a straight line to indicate they are part of a single menu.
*   **Product Carousels:** Use visual cues to show that a set of products continues off-screen, encouraging users to swipe or scroll.
*   **Data Visualization:** In graphs and charts, use continuous lines to connect related data points, making trends easier to spot.
