# Common Fate

## The Axiom

We perceive objects moving in the same direction as part of the same group.

## The Science

This is a Gestalt principle of perception. When visual elements are moving in the same direction at the same rate, we perceive them as a single group.

## Application in UX

*   **Animations:** Use animations to group related elements together. For example, a dropdown menu's items should appear to move together.
*   **Tooltips:** Tooltips and their arrows often appear at the same time and have the same movement, grouping them.
*   **Carousels:** The items in a carousel move together, indicating that they are part of a single group.
