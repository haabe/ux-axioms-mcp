# Evidencing

## The Axiom

Make the invisible parts of a service visible.

## The Science

This principle comes from service design. By showing the user what is happening "behind the scenes," you can increase their trust and confidence in the service. It is related to the labor illusion.

## Application in UX

*   **Progress Indicators:** Show the user what is happening during a long process (e.g., "verifying your details," "processing your payment").
*   **Delivery Tracking:** Pizza trackers and package tracking are classic examples of evidencing.
*   **"Show your work":** In a search interface, showing the number of results found or the filters applied is a form of evidencing.
