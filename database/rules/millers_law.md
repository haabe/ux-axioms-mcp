# Miller's Law

## Description

The average person can only keep $7 \pm 2$ items in their working memory at one time. Note: This is often misapplied to justify limiting choices to 7. Its primary value is in organizing content into manageable chunks.

## Best Practices

### Chunk information

Instead of: 1234567890
Do: (123) 456-7890

### Group related items

Instead of: A long, unstructured list of settings.
Do: Grouping settings under headings like "Profile," "Notifications," and "Security."

### Keep navigation concise

Instead of: A main navigation with 12 top-level links.
Do: A main navigation with 5-7 key links and using sub-navigation for other items.

## Typical Contexts

-   Presenting lists of features or benefits.
-   Breaking up long numbers or codes (phone numbers, credit cards, confirmation codes).
-   Organizing navigation menus and sitemaps.
-   Structuring form content.
