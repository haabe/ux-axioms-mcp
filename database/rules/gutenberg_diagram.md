# Gutenberg Diagram

## Description

A model that describes a general pattern of eye movement for scanning evenly distributed, text-heavy pages. It divides the layout into four quadrants, suggesting the eye sweeps from the Primary Optical Area (top-left) to the Terminal Area (bottom-right) in a "Z" pattern.

-   **Primary Optical Area (Top-Left):** Where the user starts. Place your logo and primary headline here.
-   **Strong Fallow Area (Top-Right):** An area of secondary importance.
-   **Weak Fallow Area (Bottom-Left):** The weakest area, often ignored.
-   **Terminal Area (Bottom-Right):** The end of the scan. Place your primary call-to-action here.

## Best Practices

### Align with the reading gravity

Place the most critical elements along the top-left to bottom-right axis.

### Place key elements strategically

-   **Top-Left:** Logo, main navigation start, key headline.
-   **Bottom-Right:** Primary Call-to-Action (e.g., "Submit", "Continue", "Sign Up").

### Keep weak areas light

Avoid placing important information or interactive elements in the Strong and Weak Fallow Areas, as they may be missed.

## Typical Contexts

-   Landing pages with a clear, simple value proposition.
-   Advertisements and posters.
-   Presentation slides.
-   Layouts that are text-heavy and not broken up by many images or complex components (where F-Pattern is more likely).
