# Proximity

## Description

The Gestalt principle of Proximity states that objects that are close to one another are perceived as being grouped together more strongly than objects that are farther apart.

## Best Practices

### Group related items with spacing

Instead of: Equal spacing between all form elements.
Do: Placing a text label very close to its corresponding input field, and then adding more white space before the next label-input pair.

### Use white space to define relationships

Instead of: A grid of images with equal gutters everywhere.
Do: Grouping a headline, an image, and a caption together with tight spacing to form a "card," and then using larger amounts of white space to separate that card from other cards.

### Link related information

The proximity of a "Forgot Password?" link directly underneath a password field implies that the action is related to that specific field.

## Typical Contexts

-   **Form Design:** Grouping labels, inputs, and error messages.
-   **Card-based Layouts:** Grouping all the content of a single item (image, title, text, button) together.
-   **Navigation & Menus:** Grouping related links together.
-   Essentially all UI layout relies on this principle to create logical structure and reduce cognitive load.
