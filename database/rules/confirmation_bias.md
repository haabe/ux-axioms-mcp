# Confirmation Bias

## Description

The tendency to search for, interpret, favor, and recall information in a way that confirms or supports one's preexisting beliefs or hypotheses. It is a type of cognitive bias and a systematic error of inductive reasoning.

## Best Practices

### For Researchers & Designers:

#### Phrase questions neutrally

Instead of: "Wasn't it easy to use that new feature?"
Do: "How would you describe your experience using the new feature?"

#### Actively seek disconfirming evidence

Instead of: Only looking for data that proves your new design is better.
Do: Specifically analyzing metrics where the new design might be underperforming and interviewing users who abandoned the flow.

### For UX Design:

#### Clearly present counter-arguments

Instead of: In a product comparison, only showing the positive aspects of the preferred product.
Do: Using a clear, objective table that shows where both products excel or fall short, building trust with the user.

## Typical Contexts

-   **User Research & Usability Testing**: A primary bias for researchers to be aware of and mitigate in themselves.
-   **A/B Testing & Data Analysis**: The temptation to interpret ambiguous results as supporting the desired outcome.
-   **Product Reviews & Comparison Tools**: Users often seek out reviews that confirm their desire to buy (or not buy) a product.
-   **Personalized Feeds**: Can create filter bubbles where users are only shown content that aligns with their existing viewpoint.
