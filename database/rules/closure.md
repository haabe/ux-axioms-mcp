# Closure

## The Axiom

The brain will perceive a whole shape even if parts of that shape are missing.

## The Science

The principle of closure is a key Gestalt principle. Our brain tends to fill in the gaps to create a complete object. We see the whole first.

## Application in UX

*   **Icons and Logos:** Many famous logos use closure (e.g., the WWF panda). It can make an icon more memorable.
*   **Loading Indicators:** A loading spinner with a gap in it is still perceived as a circle because of the law of closure.
*   **White Space:** Use white space to create incomplete shapes that the user's brain will complete, leading to a more engaging design.
