# Occam's Razor

## The Axiom

Among competing hypotheses, the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected. In design, this means favoring simpler solutions.

## The Science

The principle is attributed to William of Ockham, a 14th-century Franciscan friar, philosopher, and theologian. In a design context, it suggests that the simplest solution is often the best. Unnecessary elements and features add complexity and can make a product harder to use.

## Application in UX

*   **Feature Creep:** Be wary of adding features that are not essential to the user's goals.
*   **Minimalism:** Embrace a minimalist aesthetic, focusing on the essential elements of the design.
*   **Clarity:** A simpler design is often a clearer design. Remove anything that does not add value.
