A comprehensive database of laws, cognitive biases, and principles for UX, Service Design, and Behavioral Science.

## 🧠 1. Cognitive Psychology & Behavior (The "Laws")

* **Hick’s Law:** The time it takes to make a decision increases with the number and complexity of choices.
* **Fitts’s Law:** The time to acquire a target is a function of the distance to and size of the target.
* **Miller’s Law:** The average person can only keep $7 \pm 2$ items in their working memory.
* **Jakob’s Law:** Users spend most of their time on other sites; they prefer your site to work the same way as all the others they already know.
* **Tesler’s Law:** (The Law of Conservation of Complexity) For any system, there is a certain amount of complexity which cannot be reduced; it can only be moved.
* **Doherty Threshold:** Productivity soars when a computer and its users interact at a pace (<400ms) that ensures neither has to wait on the other.
* **Postel’s Law:** (Robustness Principle) Be liberal in what you accept, and conservative in what you send.
* **Peak-End Rule:** People judge an experience largely based on how they felt at its peak and at its end.
* **Aesthetic-Usability Effect:** Users often perceive aesthetically pleasing designs as more usable.
* **Occam's Razor:** Favor simpler solutions.
* **Serial-Position Effect:** We remember the first and last items in a series best.

## 🎯 2. Cognitive Biases (Decision Influencers)

* **Anchoring Bias:** The tendency to rely too heavily on the first piece of information offered (the "anchor") when making decisions.
* **The Pratfall Effect:** People's perceived attractiveness increases when they make a mistake—provided they are perceived as competent.
* **Social Proof:** People look to others' behaviors to guide their own actions, especially in uncertain situations.
* **Scarcity Principle:** The perception that products or services are more attractive when their availability is limited.
* **Loss Aversion:** The pain of losing is psychologically twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining.
* **Decoy Effect:** Consumers tend to have a specific change in preference between two options when presented with a third, asymmetrical option.
* **Zeigarnik Effect:** People remember uncompleted or interrupted tasks better than completed tasks.
* **Von Restorff Effect:** (Isolation Effect) When multiple similar objects are present, the one that differs from the rest is most likely to be remembered.
* **Confirmation Bias:** The tendency to search for, interpret, and recall information in a way that confirms one's prior beliefs.
* **Framing Effect:** Decisions are influenced by how information is presented.
* **Recency Bias:** More weight is given to recent experiences.
* **Social Desirability Bias:** People provide socially acceptable answers.
* **False-Consensus Bias:** We overestimate how much others agree with us.
* **The Curse of Knowledge:** Experts assume others have the same knowledge.
* **Clustering Illusion:** Seeing patterns in random data.
* **Sunk Cost Fallacy:** Continuing an investment because of past costs.

## ✍️ 3. Typography & Text Perception

* **Line Length (CPL):** The optimal number of characters per line for body text is 45–75 characters (including spaces).
* **Gutenberg Diagram:** Describes a pattern of scanning a medium in which the eye moves in a "Z" pattern.
* **F-Pattern Scanning:** Users often read screens in an "F" pattern—two horizontal stripes followed by a vertical stripe.
* **Line Height (Leading):** Text legibility is improved when line height is approximately 1.5x the font size.
* **The 3-Second Rule:** A user should be able to understand the core value proposition of a page within three seconds of landing.
* **Readability vs. Legibility:** Legibility is how well you can see the letters; readability is how easily you can understand the content.

## 👁️ 4. Gestalt Principles (Visual Perception)

* **Proximity:** Elements that are close to each other tend to be perceived as a single group.
* **Similarity:** The human eye tends to perceive similar elements in a design as a complete picture, shape, or group.
* **Continuity:** Elements arranged on a line or curve are perceived as more related than elements not on the line or curve.
* **Closure:** The brain will perceive a whole shape even if parts of that shape are missing.
* **Common Region:** Elements are perceived as part of a group if they are located within the same closed region.
* **Figure-Ground:** The eye’s tendency to separate objects from their background.
* **Common Fate:** We perceive objects moving in the same direction as part of the same group.
* **Symmetry and Order:** We tend to perceive symmetrical shapes as a group.

## 🛠️ 5. Service Design & Process Psychology

* **The Labor Illusion:** Users trust and value a service more when they can "see" the effort or process being performed.
* **Service Recovery Paradox:** A customer who has had a service failure resolved excellently is more loyal than a customer who never had a problem.
* **Goal-Gradient Effect:** The tendency to approach a goal with more effort as the goal becomes closer (e.g
* **Evidencing:** Make the invisible parts of a service visible.
